# Retinal Disease Classifier

This project implements a deep learning model for classifying **retinal fundus images** into four categories:  
**Cataract, Diabetic Retinopathy, Glaucoma, and Normal**.

Built using **PyTorch**, **FastAI** with a pretrained **ResNet50** CNN.
This model is deployed as an interactive web app with **Gradio** in Hugging Face Spaces.
