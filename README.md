# Retinal Disease Classifier

This project implements a deep learning model for classifying **retinal fundus images** into four categories:  
**Cataract, Diabetic Retinopathy, Glaucoma, and Normal**.

Built using **FastAI**, **PyTorch**, and a pretrained **ResNet50** CNN, the model is deployed as an interactive web app with **Gradio** via Hugging Face Spaces.
